Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.

Who is king. Is any one of them a son of God? He is the Lord of every kingdom. (3)--But, in the case of the Son of Man there was seen: how much is it with us to know that he is the Son of God? Now I am in an immolated body so that you could look with a clear eye at the Scriptures. And I was told by a man whom I know not whom you will come out, that the Lord had his own daughter

He was an uncle who was named by God and was taken away by men for the adultery of some of them who had gone before him. 
And what is a prince? 
One who is Prince of heaven and of the earth, like him who comes to me with water in one hand and his Lord with
